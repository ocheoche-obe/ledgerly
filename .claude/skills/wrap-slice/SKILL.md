# Wrap up a slice

Run these steps in order. The docs step is blocking: a slice is not done until the next
session can cold-start from `CLAUDE.md` alone.

> SETUP NOTE: replace the `{{...}}` placeholders (test command, doc slug) once conventions
> are set. Delete this note afterwards.

## 1. Verify the work

- Unit tests green: `{{test command, e.g. python -m pytest tests/unit -q}}`.
- If the slice changed deployed behavior, confirm it was actually deployed and smoke-tested
  end-to-end (real infra, not just unit tests). If smoke testing didn't happen, say so
  plainly — do not mark the slice complete.

## 2. Bring the docs current (blocking)

- **`docs/{{project-slug}}-plan.md`** — the linchpin. Flip the slice to ✅ on the status
  board (add the PR link once it exists), fill in its **Completion notes** (what shipped,
  what was deployed/verified, gotchas discovered, wrinkles deferred), check off exit
  criteria, and sanity-check that the *next* slice's section still reflects reality. This is
  what makes the next session's cold start cheap.
- **`CLAUDE.md` "Current build phase"** — refresh the pointer: current slice, last completed
  slice. It stays compact; detail belongs in the plan doc.
- **`docs/{{project-slug}}-adl.md`** — every decision the slice forced is captured as an ADR
  (they should already exist from /start-slice step 6; verify). Update the index table and
  the "Last updated" line.
- **`docs/{{project-slug}}-architecture.md`** — if implementation contradicted the doc,
  correct the doc (don't silently code around it — the contradiction should be explained),
  bump the version, add a change-log row.
- **`docs/{{project-slug}}-evaluation.md`** — add the slice's evaluation beat (lifecycle
  stage 6): did it meet its exit criteria, what did it actually cost, what worked, what
  surprised us, and where each finding is routed (a requirement, an ADR, a future slice, or
  the parking lot).
- **Memory** — save durable gotchas (account-level constraints, API behaviors that
  contradict docs) that future sessions need; update the memory index.

## 3. Commit and push

- Commits follow a conventional style (`feat(infra):`, `fix(...):`, `docs:`, `test:`), each
  ending with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
- Logical commits: infra / backend / tests / docs separated where it's natural.
- Push the slice branch to origin.

## 4. Open the PR

```bash
gh pr create --base main
```

PR body: what the slice delivers, exit criteria and how each was verified (including
smoke-test evidence), decisions/ADRs added, doc corrections made.

## 5. Hand off

Tell the user, explicitly:

- PR URL and what's in it.
- That after they merge, the next `/start-slice` will fast-forward local `main`.
- Any threads deliberately left open, so they land in the next session's plan rather than
  being forgotten.

Do not merge the PR yourself; merging is the user's call.
